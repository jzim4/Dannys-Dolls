# Danny's Dolls

This project was built on my knowledge from my first website, [Coffee Talk](https://github.com/jzim4/Coffee-Talk). Returning to the Coursera Course, [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers), I began working with plain Javascript.

I applied my new Javascript knowledge in order to create a Single Page Application (SPA) that imports data in real time from the headless CMS, [Contentful](contentful.com).

The contents of the site are the doll collection of my dear friend Daniel. He is able to update the data in Contentful in order to reflect his ever growing collection. I highly recommend reading some of his descriptions.
