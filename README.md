# Danny's Dolls

This is the second website I have made. In addition to using the HTML and CSS skills I developed from my first site, [Coffee Talk](https://github.com/jzim4/Coffee-Talk), I returned to the Coursera Course, [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers), to include vanilla Javascript.

I applied my new Javascript knowledge to create a Single Page Application (SPA) that imports data in real time from the headless CMS, [Contentful](contentful.com).

The contents of the site are the doll collection of my dear friend Daniel. He is able to update the data in Contentful in order to reflect his ever growing collection. I highly recommend reading some of his descriptions.
